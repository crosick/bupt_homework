A Movie Review of Pushing Hands

On 27th November, we watched a movie called Pushing Hands directed by Ang Lee in the intercultural communication class.The story is about an elderly Tai chi master Mr. Chu, who emigrates from Beijing to Westchester, New York to live with his son Alex, his American daughter-in-law Martha, and grandson Jeremy. Alex needs to work in daytime and Martha was busy in writing her second novel. She can not speak Chinese, and Mr. Chu can not speak English. So Mr. Chu has to practice Tai chi or watch some old videos to kill time.I can affirm that Mr. Chu must feel very lonely and bored in such kind of daily life. Later, Mr. Chu met Mrs. Chen at the area Chinese Community Center and Mr. Chu seemed to be well disposed toward her.Alex and Mr. Chen's daughter wanna make a match between them, so they prepared a picnic for them. Unexpectedly, two aged people thought themselves as burden in the family and felt frustration.As a result, Mr. Chu ran away from home to make a living of himself.Finally, the family found him and took him back. Alex and Martha gradually understood Mr. Chu's feeling and the meaning of pushing hand.

The performance of actors is very touching. Mr. Chu is a Chinese traditional old people, but his character is cute and simple.The distinctive characterization of this movie makes this movie interesting and impressive.Meanwhile, the main idea also makes this movie thought-provoking. It discussed the mood of the immigration who has to face the culture shock and adapt to the new life. And as an old person, he also needs to face the problem that how to adapt to the changes of the times? The answer is in Tai chi. The Pushing Hands is just like the process of this kind of adaptation.At the end of the movie, Mr. Chu achieved the balance in his life.

The conflict sometimes is inevitable. But we have the ability to seek the balance point in our life.
